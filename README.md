📊 Web Scraping: Largest Companies by Revenue
📖 Project Overview

This project uses Python web scraping techniques to collect structured data on the largest companies by revenue from Wikipedia.
The scraped data is cleaned, processed, and exported into a CSV file, making it ready for further analysis or reporting.
